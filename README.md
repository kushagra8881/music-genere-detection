# Music Genre Detection README

## Introduction
This repository contains code for a music genre detection project. The project aims to classify music into different genres using machine learning algorithms. 

## Libraries Used
- `numpy` (imported as `np`): For numerical operations and array handling.
- `pandas` (imported as `pd`): For data manipulation and analysis.
- `matplotlib.pyplot` (imported as `plt`): For data visualization, particularly plotting graphs.
- `seaborn` (imported as `sns`): For statistical data visualization.
- `librosa`: For audio and music analysis.
- `sklearn` (Scikit-learn): For machine learning algorithms and tools.
- `tensorflow.keras`: For building and training neural networks.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kushagra8881/music_genre_detection.git
